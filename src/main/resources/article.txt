Reach out touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who is there
Feeling unknown
And you are all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I will make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I am a forgiver
Reach out touch faith
Reach out touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who is there
Feeling unknown
And you are all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I will make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I am a forgiver
Reach out touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Reach out touch faith
Reach out touch faith
Reach out touch faith
Reach out reach out
Reach out touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
